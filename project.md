For this project I want to build an opencv program that will scan your face, break up the video into pictures where using pytorch it will determine if you have acne, hyperpigmentation, other skin issues, etc. I will be attaching images of all of these different skin conditions/issues in folders to train the program, so keep that in mind. After the program understands the problem, it will then do a websearch using the google store api to fins skin products that would help the users problem. It should also generate a skin care rountine if there are multiple products needed to fix the issue. I made a frontent for visual reporesentation as to how everything should look.
